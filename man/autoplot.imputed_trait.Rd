\usage{
\method{autoplot}{imputed_trait}(imputed_traits, other_col_how, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputed_traits}{output from trait_np_bootstrap or trait_parametric_bootstrap
funtion.}

\item{other_col_how}{what to do with the other columns in other data.
 Options are to `filter` by one of the columns, add them to the x-`axis`,
`facet` by them, or to `ignore`.}

Shows at which level the data are coming from in each plot.
